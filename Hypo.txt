
HYPOTHESIS:
There are no counties in the USA without a cellphone tower in its boundaries.

I understood that cell towers became more scarce in the midwest due to less population
but I also knew that counties in these areas are also larger making the hypothesis plausible.




DATA:

NOTES:
Maybe try to outline state boundaries in black?

Try to cover up the outlier in top left corner

COLOR CHOICE:
When playing around with color I noticed that super 
saturated colors realy help make the "holes" where 
there are no cellphone towers catch your eye. However, 
this made the visualization look quite unprofessional. 
By darkening the color rather than desaturating I was 
able to find a middle ground that both makes the "holes" 
pop as well as looking professional.

When choosing a color I noticed that desaturated colors made the cell tower voids 
subside. Whereas a very saturated blue made those voids stand out to your eye. 
Being that they are the focus of this visualization I wanted them to stand out.
I found that darkening the blue rather than desaturating it achieved this without 
sacrificing the professionalism of the visualization.
