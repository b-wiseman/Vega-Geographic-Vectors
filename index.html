  <h1>Geographic Vectors</h1>
  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>
    There are no counties in the United States without a cellphone tower within it's boundaries. 
  </p>  
  <h2> Data Sources</h2>
  <p>
    All data was taken from <a href="https://data.world/dhs/cellular-towers">https://data.world/dhs/cellular-towers</a>
  </p>


  <div id="vis2"></div>

  <script>
    const spec2 = "map.vl.json";
    vegaEmbed("#vis2", spec2)
      // result.view provides access to the Vega View API
      .then(result => console.log(result))
      .catch(console.warn);

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    My hypothesis stemmed from the understanding that cell towers become more scarce the further west you are 
    in the United States while counties also tend to become larger, allowing for a higher chance of containing 
    at least one cell phone tower. After visualizing the data I found that there are in fact multiple US counties 
    without a cellphone tower within their boundaries. However, it is a very small amount. A measly 10 out of 
    3,006 counties in the US do not have a cell phone tower within their boundaries as of 2016. It is possible that 
    in 2022 these counties have since aquired a tower but the only applicable data I could find was from 2016.
    <br><br>
    The most interesting part of this visualization is the northmost void in Texas. This is where Dallas is located.
    This makes me think that there is some sort of law or policy that does not allow cell phone towers to be built 
    in the metropolitan area of Dallas.

  <h2>Color Choice</h2>
    <p>
      When choosing a color I noticed that desaturated colors made the cell tower voids 
      subside whereas a very bright and saturated blue made them stand out to the eye. 
      Being that these voids are the focus of this visualization I wanted them to stand out
      but was also aware that a very saturated blue made the visualization feel unprofessional.
      I found that darkening the blue rather than desaturating it achieved this without 
      sacrificing the professional credibility of the visualization.
